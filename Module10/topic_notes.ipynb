    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is in essence is defining members and methods, then creating objects to utilize those members and methods. It also includes the idea of restricting access. This makes code cleaner and more maintainable. Modules and namespaces in Python were useful ways to organize code, classes and OOP takes that organization one step further. Although Python does not have the keyword private you may see in other languages to restrict access, it uses convention and name mangling. \n",
