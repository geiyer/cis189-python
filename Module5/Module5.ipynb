    "As the structure theorem (also called the BÃ¶hm-Jacopini theorem) states, if a problem can be solved efficiently with a program, it can be solved using these three structures, sequential, selection and repetiion. Some problems are intractable, meaning there is no efficient algorithm to solve them, thus the necessary distinction of \"if a problem can be solved efficiently.\" If that intrigues you, you can check out Complexity Theory, that is beyond the scope this course.\n",
