    "### Pillars: \n",
    "* Encapsulation:\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is in essence is defining members and methods, then creating objects to utilize those members and methods. It also includes the idea of restricting access. This makes code cleaner and more maintainable. Modules and namespaces in Python were useful ways to organize code, classes and OOP takes that organization one step further. Although Python does not have the keyword private you may see in other languages to restrict access, it uses convention and name mangling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Inheritance:\n",
    "    * Inheritance is a way of one class to derive the properties from another class. \n",
    "    * It provides reusability of a code. \n",
    "    * Modify the behaviour defined in other class\n",
    "    * Base Class:\n",
    "        * The class whose members are inherited is called the base class\n",
    "    * Derived Class:\n",
    "        * The class that inherits those membes is called the derived class\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polymorphism\n",
    "    * Simply stated, includes having \"many forms\". \n",
    "    * In many languages, Polymorphism can occur with multiple constructors. \n",
    "    * With Python's powerful and succinct constructors and the use of default values, you do not use many constructors. However, derived class can have methods of the same name as in the base that override the base class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstraction\n",
    "    * Abstract classes allow you to create blueprint of a class.\n",
    "    * Minimal set of methods that establishes the characteristic behaviour of the type. \n",
    "    * Inheriting class should implement the abstract methods\n",
    "    * Abstract class cannot be instantiated\n"
